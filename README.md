nFrame
======

it is a framework for node.js 

#The Idea

Idea is that i want this framework to work like jquery method of selectors.
So this framework would return a function $ where you can pass selectors, which are actualy 
a module name or api that they want to load.

for eg. $('global') loads the global module that has all the GET, POST, COOKIES, and SESSION.

plus it has aim to give ease of php to nodejs users.
